# READ All About It

## Description

This project is to learn more about NodeJS and the ways in which one can generate a file from the back-end. The application allows the user to answer a series of questions and then generate a Professional README file for their project through their CLI. The README then has the necessary sections and is editable for the user to add images and other content after it is generated.

## Installation

To install the project, the user must have nodeJS installed for their CLI, which they can access here: <https://nodejs.org/en/download>. They must then copy the files from the repo to their own machine and download the necessary dependencies by entering ```npm install``` in their CLI. The only necessary package for this project so far is Inquirer.

The repo can be found at <https://github.com/Benhwaet/READ-All-About-It> to copy the relevant files.

## Usage

To use the project, the user must navigate to the relevant folder in the CLI and enter node index.js, which will run the program. All that remains is answering the questions so that the content is generated in a README file.

## Credits

The starter code was provided by edX in the content of a Full-Stack Bootcamp hosted by the University of New Brunswick (UNB).
Comments in the project will indicate which sections were helped by user repos and gists in GitHub, as well as websites dedicated to licenses.

The license list and summary descriptions are taken from <https://choosealicense.com/licenses/> and lukas-h's license-badges.md on GitHub Gist <https://gist.github.com/lukas-h/2a5d00690736b4c3a7ba>, where the code for the badges (image and url) were provided.

Furthermore, when in doubt of the sturcture or export/import issues, the class modules for the bootcamp, also provided by edX were used as a guide.

I also consulted Alex McKinnon's project repo at <https://github.com/aedelfrid/README-GEN/tree/main> for help on pinpointing the chosen license.

The validation code for the email entry was taken from the validate-email-inquirer.prompt gist from Amitabh-K/index.js at <https://gist.github.com/Amitabh-K/ae073eea3d5207efaddffde19b1618e8>.

## Contribute

Anyone can contribute to the project by forking or cloning the repo. They will need to download the dependencies themselves, in this case Inquirer, and are able to push changed for approval.

## Tests

The only tests performed were the constant running of the application in teh CLI to eliminate errors and verify correct file generation.
